# bash-script-practice
 A practice of bash scripting as well as some wireless techniques. The jam programs are made for jamming the router signals by sending the deauth signals as well as for catching the handshake for further cracking. Monitor/Managed scripts are QoL scripts, switches the wireless interface from Monitor to managed mode and vice versa. The pingsweeper is a pure practice, not really usable.
